# TODO List

## For release 3.1

### Know Bugs

- [ ] Nginx: If you put a root domain to create a new project, it should ask you if you want to use www subdomain.
        Also, if you use www, it should ask you if you want to use the root domain too.
- [ ] When restore a backup and change project_name or/and project_domain the script fails:
        - If the main domain detected is a root-domain like mydomain.com the "search and replace" 
          will replace https://www.mydomain.com by https://www.test.mydomain.com
        - If decide to generate new certificate on root-domain, it fails to generate nginx config
- [ ] Project creation fails when use project name like 'myproject_name' (has an underscore).
- [ ] Backups: make_project_backup is broken, it needs a refactor!
- [ ] Project Utils: Delete doesn't work on tools (netdata, phpmyadmin).
- [ ] Notifications: Email HTML breaks sometimes.

### Need improvements

- [ ] Core: need to check if selecto domain is a root domain or www domain, and ask if the user want to create a redirection.
- [ ] Core: create a way to check if nginx, php, and other parameters are correct before run the script.
- [ ] Nginx: new default nginx configuration for wordpress projects fails after running certbot.
- [ ] LetsEncrypt: need a better way to re-install a certificate after a website migration.
- [ ] LetsEncrypt: when delete a certificate, nginx config fails.
- [ ] Project: on project delete, if the script can't find the user, maybe it will be better list all mysql users with database permision (before database deletion).
- [ ] Cloudflare: the script should ask you if you want to work with Cloudflare support (also when you create a new project).
- [ ] Cloudflare: if migrate a site with certificates generated by python3-certbot-cloudflare, the certbot will fail.
      Maybe we could ask if it has the proxy enable via Cloudflare API and disable before generate new certificates.

### Need more testing

- [ ] Nginx: Option to copy or generate a new nginx server configuration.
- [ ] Nginx: Globals configs support.
- [ ] PHP: Option to enable or disable OpCache.
- [ ] WordPress: Install fails when set a project name like: xyz_sub_domain.
- [ ] Backups: When restore or create a new project and the db_user already exists, we need to ask what todo (new user or continue?).
- [ ] Installers: On LEMP setup, after basic installation must init plugin options wizard before ask to install aditional packages.

### In Progress

- [ ] Core: On project creation/restore need to ask first the project state, then project domain.
        If project state != prod and subdomains is not containing the stage, need to suggest one.
        Example: test.multiplacas.broobe.hosting OK
        Example 2: multiplacas.broobe.hosting X (OK only if prod).
- [ ] Notifications: malware scans and others scheduled options.
- [ ] WP-CLI: wpcli_search_and_replace receives domains instead urls (ex: domain.com instead http://domain.com).
- [ ] Restore-project: cant restore non-wp projects.
- [ ] Restore-database: granting privileges to user fails, database_name is empty.
- [ ] Core: Add an option to support non LEMP anviroment (DB-only, Websever+PHP only, other). 
      Need to change if later the script detects a php, nginx o mysql installation.
- [ ] Core: Refactor of script_configuration_wizard.
- [ ] Nginx: Better nginx config: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/nginx
- [ ] Nginx: At startup, check if nginx has globals installed.
- [ ] Project Utils: Add delete database and create database option.
