# TODO List

## For release 3.1

### Know Bugs

- [ ] Nginx: If you put a root domain to create a new project, it should ask you if you want to use www subdomain.
        Also, if you use www, it should ask you if you want to use the root domain too.
- [ ] When restore a backup and change project_name or/and project_domain the script fails:
        - If the main domain detected is a root-domain like mydomain.com the "search and replace" 
          will replace https://www.mydomain.com by https://www.test.mydomain.com
        - If the main domain detected is not a root-domain, will failt to detect a proper project_name
        - If decide to generate new certificate on root-domain, it fails to generate nginx config
- [ ] Project creation fails when use project name like 'myproject_name' (has an underscore).
- [ ] Backups: make_project_backup is broken, it needs a refactor!
- [ ] Project Utils: Delete doesn't work on tools (netdata, phpmyadmin).

### Need improvements

- [ ] Core: Create a way to check if nginx, php, and other parameters are correct before run the script.
- [ ] Nginx: New default nginx configuration for wordpress projects fails after running certbot.
- [ ] LetsEncrypt: Need a better way to re-install a certificate after a website migration.
- [ ] Project: on project delete, if the script can't find the user, maybe it will be better list all mysql users with database permision (before database deletion).
- [ ] Cloudflare: The script should ask you if you want to work with Cloudflare support (also when you create a new project).
- [ ] Cloudflare: If migrate a site with certificates generated by python3-certbot-cloudflare, the certbot will fail.
      Maybe we could ask if it has the proxy enable via Cloudflare API and disable before generate new certificates.

### Need more testing

- [ ] Nginx: Option to copy or generate a new nginx server configuration.
- [ ] Nginx: Globals configs support.
- [ ] PHP: Option to enable or disable OpCache.
- [ ] WordPress: Install fails when set a project name like: xyz_sub_domain.
- [ ] Backups: When restore or create a new project and the db_user already exists, we need to ask what todo (new user or continue?).
- [ ] Installers: On LEMP setup, after basic installation must init plugin options wizard before ask to install aditional packages.
- [ ] MySQL: when create a new user, ask what kind of connection do you want: localhost or % (any host).
        Example: CREATE USER 'bruser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'sdasdasas'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bruser'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

### In Progress
