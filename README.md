## Supports

Works on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## IMPORTANT: Read before install

The script needs to be runned by root.

The script is based on this standard:

If you want to create a new web project for mydomain.com it will create:
* A database with name 'MYDOMAIN_STAGE' (the script will ask you the project stage). Ex: mydomain_prod
* A database user with name 'MYDOMAIN_user'. Ex: mydomain_user
* A directory for the project files named 'mydomain.com'.
* A nginx configuration for 'mydomain.com'.

So, the restore script only works if this nomenclature is respected.

## Installation

If git is not installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git -y
```

Cloning repo (gitHub):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpadula/lemp-utils-scripts
```

Change directories to the new ~/lemp-utils-script directory:

```bash
cd ~/lemp-utils-scripts
```

## Getting started

Give the execution permission to the script:

```bash
chmod +x runner.sh
```

Run it:

```bash
./runner.sh
```

The first time you run `runner.sh`, you'll be guided through a wizard in order to configure it. This configuration will be stored in `~/.lemp-utils-script`.

## Update script

Run updater.sh

```bash
./updater.sh
```

## Running as cron job

This script relies on a different configuration file for each system user. The default configuration file location is `root/.broobe-utils-script`.
This means that if you setup the script with your user and then you try to run a cron job as root, it won't work.

* To setup the script to run as a cron job please use the option "CRON TASKS"

## Running tasks without menu

You can run some tasks like this:

```
./runner.sh --task "cloudflare-api" --subtask "clear_cache" --domain "broobe.com"
```
